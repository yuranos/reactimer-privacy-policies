# Privacy Policy for Reactimer

**Effective Date:** August 20, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Reactimer ("the App," "we," "us," or "our") handles information when you use our mobile application.

## 1. Information We Do Not Collect

Reactimer is designed with your privacy in mind. We **do not** collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) from you or your device. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Your name, email address, phone number, or other contact information.
*   Precise or approximate location data.
*   Photos, videos, audio, or other user files.
*   Contacts or calendar information.
*   Unique device identifiers used for tracking your personal activity across apps or websites (beyond what is necessary for ad serving, as detailed below).
*   Financial and payment information (all in-app purchases are processed by Google Play Store, and we do not have access to your payment details).
*   Health information or other sensitive data.

The timer configurations you create are stored locally on your device only and are not transmitted to us or any third party.

## 2. Information Collected by Third-Party Services

While Reactimer itself does not collect your personal data, we use the following third-party services which may collect information as described in their respective privacy policies:

*   **Google AdMob (Advertisements):**
    *   Reactimer displays advertisements through Google AdMob to help support the app.
    *   AdMob may collect and use data to provide personalized advertising. This data may include device identifiers (like Advertising ID), IP address, and information about your interaction with ads.
    *   We do not have direct access to or control over the data collected by AdMob.
    *   You can learn more about Google's advertising policies and how to manage your ad preferences here:
        *   Google Advertising Policies: [https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads)
        *   How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services: [https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites)
    *   Users can typically opt-out of personalized advertising through their device settings.

*   **Google Play Billing (In-App Purchases):**
    *   If you choose to make an in-app purchase (e.g., "Remove Ads" or "Unlock More Sounds"), the transaction is processed by the Google Play Store.
    *   Google collects payment information necessary to complete the transaction. We do not receive or store your payment card details or other sensitive financial information.
    *   Google's handling of your data is governed by the Google Payments Privacy Notice and the Google Privacy Policy:
        *   Google Privacy Policy: [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

## 3. How We Use Non-Personal Information

Any non-personal, aggregated, or anonymized data that might be indirectly collected through the use of the aforementioned third-party services (e.g., aggregated ad performance metrics) is used solely for the purpose of improving the App and understanding usage patterns to enhance user experience.

## 4. Data Security

Since we do not collect or store your personal data, the primary security concern relates to the data stored locally on your device (timer configurations). We rely on the security measures provided by your device's operating system.

## 5. Children's Privacy

Reactimer is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal information without parental consent, we will take steps to remove such information. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with information, please contact us.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on our website (if applicable) and updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.

## 7. Your Consent

By using Reactimer, you consent to this Privacy Policy.
